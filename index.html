    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
  <p>
    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
    Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
    share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <p>
        Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
        Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
        introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
        <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
        plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

      <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

      <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
