    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
  <p>
    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
    Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
    share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
        Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
        introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
        <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
        plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
